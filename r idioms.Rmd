This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring web pages (click the **Help** toolbar button for more details on using R Markdown).

When you click the **Knit HTML** button a web page will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
summary(cars)
```

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r fig.width=7, fig.height=6}
plot(cars)
```

R Idioms

* Tom Short's R Reference Card
http://cran.r-project.org/doc/contrib/Short-refcard.pdf
* avoid explicit calls to return()
* a function consists of its arguments, body and environment 
* function + environment = closure or function closure 
* scoping rules determine how a value is associated with a free variable in a function
* lexical/static scoping in R means that the values of free variables are searched for 
in the environment in which the function was defined (vs. dynamic scoping)
* clear workspace rm(list=ls(all=TRUE))
* "scalars" are vectors of length 1
* vector recycling and vectorized/element-by-element operations
* sequences of numbers: `:`, seq(), rep()
* atomic data types: numeric, character, logical, integer, complex
* the most basic object is the vector; a vector can only contain objects of the same class
* NA is a placeholder for a quantity that is not available
* y<-rnorm(1000); (random draw from standard normal distribution)
z<-rep(NA,1000); 
myData<-sample(c(y,z),100); (select 100 elements at random from combining y and z)
myNA<-is.na(myData); (myNA is a logical vector)
* 0/0; Inf-Inf
* index vectors come in four different flavors:
logical vectors, vectors of positive integers, vectors of negative integers, 
vectors of character strings
* a vector of all NAs in x: x[is.na(x)] (is.na(x) is a logical index vector)
* a vector of all non-NA values in x: x[!is.na(x)] 
* x[!is.na(x) & x>0]
* x[1:10] (1:10 is an index vector of positive integers)
* x[c(3,5,7)] (c(3,5,7) is an index vector of positive integers)
* x[c(-3,-5,-7)] or x[-c(3,5,7)] (c(-3,-5,-7) is an index vector of positive integers returns 
all elements of x EXCEPT for the 3rd, 5th and 7th)
* R uses one-based indexing 
* named vectors: names(vect)<-c("foo","bar","norf")
* identical()
* vect[c("foo", "bar")] (c("foo", "bar") is an index vector of character string)
* attributes(myVector)
* class(myVector)
* a matrix is simply an atomic vector with a dimension attribute; a matrix can
only contain one class of data
* coercion, implicit and explicit
* data.frame() 
* colnames(myData)<-cnames to set the colnames attribute of our data frame
* class(monitordata) "data.frame"; class(monitordata[pollutant]) "data.frame";
class(monitordata[,pollutant]) "numeric";
* R variable types are called modes
* for (i in seq(x))
* an R list is similar to a Python dictionary: names(l) to get the tags, unlist(l) to get the values
